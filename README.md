Project Overview:

  This project aims to predict the final year grades (G3) of students based on various socio-economic, personal, and 
  academic factors using machine learning models. The dataset used for this analysis includes student performance data in 
  both Math and Portuguese courses.

Data Sources

   The datasets used in this project are sourced from:
   student-mat.csv: Student performance in Math
   student-por.csv: Student performance in Portuguese

These datasets were originally used in the study by Cortez and Silva (2008) and contain various features related to student demographics, social and economic context, and academic performance.


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


Key insights include:

    The Math dataset has 395 rows and 33 columns
    The Portuguese dataset has 649 rows and 33 columns
    Both datasets contain the same number of columns but different numbers of students
    No missing values
    Both datasets have similar distributions for most variables.
    The average age of students in both datasets is around 16.7 years.
    The median education levels of parents (Medu, Fedu) are quite similar.
    The G3 (final grade) variable has a slightly higher mean in the Portuguese dataset (11.9) compared to the Math dataset 
    (10.4).
    Absences are generally lower in the Portuguese dataset (mean of 3.66) compared to the Math dataset (mean of 5.71).
    These observations provide an initial understanding of the data distributions and central tendencies, which are 
    crucial for the regression analysis on G3.
    Academic performance is consistently negatively impacted by the number of failures across both subjects.
    Higher parental education levels are associated with better academic performance.
    There are weak correlations between absences and academic performance, suggesting that absences alone may not 
    significantly affect grades.
    Age has a slight negative correlation with performance, indicating that younger students tend to perform slightly better.
    Alcohol consumption is inversely related to study time, and higher consumption is generally associated with lower 
    academic performance.
    
    Categorical Features Analysis:
    School Distribution: GP student count is dominating MS student count in both dataset especially in the Math
    Sex: The gender distribution shows a relatively balanced split between male and female students in both subjects. With 
    slight advantage for females in both data sets
    Address: A larger proportion of students come from urban areas (U) compared to rural areas (R).
    Family Size: Most students come from medium-sized to big families (GT3).
    Parental Status: The majority of studentsâ€™ parents live together (T).
    Parental Jobs: The most common jobs for mothers and fathers are teacher and services, respectively.
    Reason for Choosing the School: The primary reason for choosing the school is course preference.
    Guardian: Most students are under the guardianship of their mother.
    Support and Activities: School support (schoolsup) is generally lower and family support (famsup) is generally high, 
    while a significant proportion of students participate in extracurricular activities (activities) and plan to pursue 
    higher education (higher).
    Internet Access: Most students have access to the internet at home.
    Romantic Relationships: A notable proportion of students are in romantic relationships.

    Free Time: Students have a moderate amount of free time.
    Going Out: Students' frequency of going out is balanced, with no extreme tendencies.
    Alcohol Consumption: Both weekday (Dalc) and weekend (Walc) alcohol consumption are generally low, with an increase 
    over weekends.
    Health: Health ratings are fairly high, with most students reporting good health.
    
    Continuous Features Analysis
    Age: The age distribution of students is concentrated around 15-18 years.
    Failures: Most students have no past class failures, though a few have one or more.
    Absences: The number of absences varies widely, with many students having few or no absences
    Grades: The distributions of the grades (G1, G2, G3) show that most students perform moderately well, though there is 
    variability, with some students scoring very low or very high.
    
    Relationships Between Variables
    Age and Study Time: Older students tend to study less, potentially due to increasing responsibilities or workload.
    Study Time and Grades: A positive relationship is observed between study time and final grades (G3), suggesting that 
    more study time could lead to better performance.
    Failures and Grades: Students with more past failures tend to have lower final grades.
    Absences and Grades: A negative correlation exists between absences and grades, indicating that higher absenteeism 
    leads to lower performance.
